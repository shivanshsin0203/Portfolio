# Express EJS Viewer

This is a simple Node.js Express application that serves static pages using the EJS template engine.

## Features

- **EJS Views**: Seamlessly renders pages using EJS.
- **Static Files**: All static files, such as CSS and JavaScript, are served from the `public` directory.
- **Defined Routes**: Pre-defined routes for Home (`/`), About (`/about`), and Contact (`/contact`) pages.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-link]
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd [your-repo-directory]
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start, and you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
